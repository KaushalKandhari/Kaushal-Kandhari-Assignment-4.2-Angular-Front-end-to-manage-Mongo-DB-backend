This is a code for front end data stored in the server in the previous assignment. The angular front end calls Cricket backend Mongo DB to add, update and delete the cricket players in the DB.
The api we created in the previous assignment is 'cricketapi' and the name of the Mongo database we created is 'cricket'.
